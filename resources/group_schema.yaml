            Configuration for uploading tracks and track hub to a server over
            rsync, called as `rsync <locally-prepared track hub>
            <user>@<host>:<hub_remote>`. If deleted, empty, or set to empty
            strings, then you'll need to provide these details on the command
            line when calling `hubward upload`. Those command line arguments
            also override the corresponding option configured here.
        properties:

            host:
                type: string
                description: |
                    Host name where tracks will be rsynced. Override at command line with `--host <HOST>`.

                    `hub_url` configured above. Override at command line with
