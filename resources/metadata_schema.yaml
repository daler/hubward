    Configure a study with tracks. The study will appear as a 'composite track'
    in the genome browser, with a table of the tracks defined below
    individually configurable.

                    Short label for track. This will appear in the track
                    selection table.
                default: example bed

                description: |
                    Optional long label for track that will be shown in some
                    places in the genome browser. If not provided, short_label
                    will be used.
                default: Demo with a small number of BED features
            original:
                type: string
                description: |
                    Path to the original data file, relative to this config
                    file. If the original file doesn't already exist, then the
                    source section below will be used to download and extract
                    the data. Sometimes that process can be time/space
                    consuming, so you may want to make sure it exists already.
                default: raw-data/a.dat
            processed:
                type: string
                description: |
                    Path to the desired processed data file, relative to this
                    config file. Output is expected to be in one of the formats
                    supported by UCSC track hubs (currently BAM, VCF, bigBed,
                    or bigWig)
                default: processed-data/a.bigbed
            script:
                type: string

                    Path to the conversion script, relative to this config
                    file. The script can be in any language. The requirments
                    are that 1) it is executable, 2) it accepts two positional
                    arguments, <input> <output>. Using the values of
                    'original','processed', and 'script', hubward calls the
                    script from the shell as `script original processed`.

                            `original` does not exist, this URL will be
                            downloaded to `<here>/raw-data/<fn>`, where <here> is
                            the dirname of this config file and <fn> is defined below.

                            .tar.gz, or .zip, it will be automatically
                            extracted. If the extension is .gz (but not
                            .tar.gz), it will not be uncompressed.

                    This dictionary is interpreted as keyword arguments to the
                    trackhub.Track constructor. These are used to set things
                    like track visibility, bigBed field counts, color, signal
                    y-axes, and other track-specific configuration. This
                    example says to expect a 4-column bigBed file (chrom,
                    start, stop, name), show the track in dense visibility mode
                    by default, and appear red (R, G, B color tuple).

                    Description of the study to be included in the HTML
                    documentation. This is assumed to be in ReStructured Text
                    format, which is converted to HTML. If you're using
                    a metadata-builder.py script, a common pattern is to
                    include the contents of a README file in this field. This
                    is by far the most verbose section, and is used to describe
                    where the data came from as well as any processing that was
                    needed to convert into a format supported by the UCSC
                    Genome Browser.
                default: Example data were prepared ahead of time and are stored in the hubward repository to facilitate testing.

            Each item in this list describes a single track in the composite
            view for this study. For each track, hubward will check to see if
            the output file ('processed') is older than the input file
            ('original') or the configured script. If so, then it calls 'script
            original processed' to update the output.
